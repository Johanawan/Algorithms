# Pythonâ€™s random module includes a function choice(data) that returns a
# random element from a non-empty sequence. The random module includes a more basic function randrange, with parameterization similar to
# the built-in range function, that return a random choice from the given
# range. Using only the randrange function, implement your own version
# of the choice function.

from random import randrange

def listComprehension():
    numbers = [randrange(0,100)**2 for i in range(10)]
    return numbers

res = listComprehension()

print(res)
